# chargeMassWebApp

A quick app that matches with the display and magnets in the P1 charge/mass ratio experiment. A quicknumerical solution (not the most efficient by any means) but hides the back end and if it could be hosted maybe a useful tool. Error is not taken into account but some random jitter could most likely be added.
